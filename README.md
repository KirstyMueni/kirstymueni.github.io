### Adding More Images to Project Galleries

To add multiple images to a project gallery:

1. Place your images in the `images/` or `assets/` folder.
2. In `index.html`, find the project section you want to update.
3. Add hidden links with the same `data-lightbox` value:

```html
<!-- Main visible button -->
<a href="assets/cyber-security.jpg" data-lightbox="cybersecurity" data-title="Cybersecurity - Threat Analysis" class="btn-small">View Images</a>

<!-- Hidden gallery images -->
<a href="assets/cyber-security-2.jpg" data-lightbox="cybersecurity" data-title="Cybersecurity - Vulnerability Scan" style="display: none;"></a>
<a href="assets/cyber-security-3.jpg" data-lightbox="cybersecurity" data-title="Cybersecurity - Security Dashboard" style="display: none;"></a>
```
